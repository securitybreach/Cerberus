Backing up and retrieving a list of installed packages
It is good practice to keep periodic backups of all pacman-installed packages. In the event of a 
system crash which is unrecoverable by other means, pacman can then easily reinstall the very same 
packages onto a new installation.

First, backup the current list of non-local packages: $ pacman -Qqen > pkglist.txt
Store the pkglist.txt on a USB key or other convenient medium or gist.github.com or Evernote, 
Dropbox, etc.
Copy the pkglist.txt file to the new installation, and navigate to the directory containing it.
Issue the following command to install from the backup list: # pacman -S $(< pkglist.txt)
In the case you have a list which was not generated like mentioned above, there may be foreign 
packages in it (i.e. packages not belonging to any repos you have configured, or packages from the 
AUR).

In such a case, you may still want to install all available packages from that list:

# pacman -S --needed $(comm -12 <(pacman -Slq|sort) <(sort badpkdlist) )
